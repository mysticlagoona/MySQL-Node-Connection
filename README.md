# MySQL-Node-Connection



Try to understand what happens in this program. How is the database connection created? How do we use the connection to query the database?

All the functions are in the program.js

Look at db.sql. It is used to create a database. In the todo_app/program.js file there's a little program that should be able to extract TODOs from the database, update them, and delete them.

Run npm install inside the todo_app directory to download and install the MySQL connector.
